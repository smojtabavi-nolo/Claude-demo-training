# Lab 04 — Give Claude Eyes & Ears: Connecting Dynamic Data Sources

## Objective

Improve Claude's next answer by connecting it to the right dynamic data sources and feedback artifacts.

## Why This Lab Exists

Static prompts are rarely enough once work becomes interactive. This lab teaches participants to connect Claude to the runtime evidence that changes the quality of its reasoning.

## Scenario

Claude produced a partial fix, but the result is still wrong. Your task is to avoid vague feedback like “that didn't work” and instead supply concrete evidence.

## Dynamic Data Sources

Use at least three of the following:

- logs
- failing test output
- CLI output
- screenshot of the broken UI or state
- app simulator output or emulator trace
- MCP server output
- API or schema documentation
- GitHub issue or PR discussion
- diff excerpt showing the suspicious area
- short written observation about what changed versus what was expected

## Example Request Changes

An acceptable bundle might include:

- one failing test run
- one CLI trace showing the command that triggered the failure
- one short explanation of expected versus observed behavior
- one screenshot or simulator observation if the problem is visual
- one link or MCP lookup for the relevant external contract or issue

## Example Revised Instruction

```text
The previous change still fails.

Evidence:
- failing test: the old refresh token still validates after rotation
- CLI output from `pnpm demo`: `OLD token still valid?  true`
- docs note: a rotated refresh token must reject reuse of the old token

Revise SessionStore.rotate so the old token is invalidated on rotation.
Do not change the login response shape.
Explain which file changed and why.
```

## Exercises

1. Run the failing command or test.
2. Capture the smallest useful output.
3. Connect at least one non-test dynamic source such as logs, docs, issues, screenshots, simulator output, or MCP context.
4. Summarize the failure in one precise sentence.
5. Ask Claude to revise the fix using only the supplied artifacts.

## Teaching Focus

- give evidence, not frustration
- reduce noise before pasting output
- tell Claude what to focus on in the artifact
- distinguish reproduction evidence from diagnosis
- connect live context, not just static prose

## Deliverable

Create a Request Changes containing:

- one failing artifact
- one connected dynamic data source beyond the failing artifact
- one observation
- one revised instruction to Claude
- one sentence explaining why this feedback is better than a generic correction

Use [request-changes-example.md](request-changes-example.md) as a model for the final submission.

## Pass Criteria

This lab passes when the participant can show:

- that the feedback uses concrete evidence
- that at least one dynamic source is connected beyond the raw failure
- that the revised instruction is more actionable than “fix this”

## Suggested Reflection

Which dynamic source added the most decision-making value, and why?
